title: 'Refusals and recovery'
description: 'The structured refusal shapes the step tool returns, and how an agent recovers from them.'
---

`step` returns a structured refusal for any of five conditions, each distinguished
by the `error` field. Every refusal carries `valid_next_actions` from the current
state, so an agent with no model of the graph can self-correct in one turn.

## `invalid_transition`

The action exists but is not reachable from the current state. The graph
blocked it before the action body ran, so no state changed.

```json
{
  "error": "invalid_transition",
  "requested": "pay",
  "valid_next_actions": ["take_order"],
  "message": "action 'pay' is not reachable from current state. Valid actions now: ['take_order']."
}
```

The agent retries with one of `valid_next_actions`.

## `unknown_action`

The requested action is not in the FSM at all (a typo or a hallucinated verb),
as opposed to `invalid_transition`, where the action exists but is not reachable
yet. The response carries `known_actions`, every action name in the graph.

```json
{
  "error": "unknown_action",
  "requested": "tako_order",
  "known_actions": ["take_order", "add_modifier", "pay", "fulfill", "cancel"]
}
```

## `validation_failed`

The action is reachable, but an input validator rejected the inputs before the
body ran. State is unchanged.

```json
{
  "error": "validation_failed",
  "requested": "add_modifier",
  "reason": "modifier must be one of: oat, soy, almond",
  "details": { "field": "modifier", "got": "moon" },
  "valid_next_actions": ["add_modifier", "pay", "cancel"]
}
```

Validators are wired through `mount(..., input_validators={...})`: a dict
mapping action name to a callable `(state_dict, inputs) -> dict | None`. It
runs after the reachability check and before the action body. Raise
`theodosia.ValidationFailed("reason", details={...})` to refuse; return `None`
to accept the inputs as-is; return a dict to substitute normalized inputs.

```python
from theodosia import ValidationFailed, mount

def check_modifier(state, inputs):
    if inputs.get("modifier") not in {"oat", "soy", "almond"}:
        raise ValidationFailed(
            "modifier must be one of: oat, soy, almond",
            details={"field": "modifier", "got": inputs.get("modifier")},
        )
    return None

mount(build_application, input_validators={"add_modifier": check_modifier})
```

## `action_timeout`

The action was reachable and ran, but exceeded `action_timeout_seconds`
(configured on `mount`). It surfaces as a refusal rather than a hang.

The timeout fires for both async and sync action bodies. Sync bodies are
detected and run in a worker thread so a blocking call (`time.sleep`, a
blocking HTTP request, a tight CPU loop) cannot freeze the event loop and
defeat the timer. The orphaned thread keeps running until the body
returns; Python cannot safely kill threads, so the client gets the
structured refusal while the body completes in the background.

The budget is enforced with `asyncio.wait` rather than `asyncio.wait_for`
so the timer fires at the boundary regardless of whether the inner await
honors cancellation. Action bodies awaiting on a `ctx.sample` or
`ctx.elicit` server-to-client request fall into this category: FastMCP's
elicit/sample awaits do not propagate cancellation cleanly. The
``action_timeout`` envelope is set at the budget; on stdio / http / sse
transports the wire response is also delivered at the budget. On the
in-memory transport the outgoing tool response is serialized behind the
outstanding elicit request, so a client awaiting `call_tool` may not see
the response until the upstream elicit completes (typically the FastMCP
default request timeout). This is an in-memory transport semantic, not
an action-budget bug; production deployments do not hit it.

```json
{
  "error": "action_timeout",
  "requested": "fetch_report",
  "timeout_seconds": 30,
  "message": "action 'fetch_report' exceeded its 30s timeout.",
  "valid_next_actions": ["fetch_report", "cancel"]
}
```

## `action_error`

The action was reachable and ran, but its body raised. The exception type and
message are passed through so the agent can react to the actual failure (a bad
file path, a failed precondition, an upstream error).

```json
{
  "error": "action_error",
  "requested": "edit_file",
  "error_type": "ValueError",
  "error_message": "must read the file before editing it",
  "valid_next_actions": ["read_file", "edit_file"]
}
```

This is the second gate described in [Authoring](authoring.md): the graph
refuses out-of-order calls with `invalid_transition`; an action body raising
`ValueError` for a finer precondition surfaces here. Both are recoverable.

## The recovery contract

Every response, success or refusal, carries `valid_next_actions`. A successful
step also returns the action's result and the new state. So the agent's loop is
the same whether the last step succeeded or was refused: read
`valid_next_actions`, pick one, send the next `step`. The current valid actions
are also always available out of band at the [`theodosia://next`](tools.md)
resource and the full attempt timeline, including refusals, at
`theodosia://history`.
