description: 'How mount() turns a Burr Application into an MCP server.'
---

`mount()` wraps a Burr `Application` in a FastMCP server, registers four MCP
tools (`step`, `reset_session`, `fork_at`, `fork_from_past`), and exposes the
`theodosia://` resource family for the agent.

## Graph topology

The agent can only move along the graph's edges; the server refuses any step that
is not a reachable transition. `theodosia render <target>` prints the graph in the
terminal (or `--mermaid` / `--dot` for docs):

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> take_order
    take_order --> pay
    take_order --> add_modifier
    take_order --> cancel
    add_modifier --> pay
    add_modifier --> add_modifier
    add_modifier --> cancel
    pay --> fulfill
    fulfill --> [*]
    cancel --> [*]
```

## The four-tool surface

Every server mounted in STEP mode registers the same tools regardless of how
complex the FSM is:

- `step(action, inputs)` runs one transition. Annotated
  `destructiveHint=True, idempotentHint=False`.
- `reset_session()` rebuilds this session's Application from the factory.
  Annotated `destructiveHint=True, idempotentHint=True`.
- `fork_at(sequence_id)` rolls this session back to a prior history entry.
  Annotated `destructiveHint=True, openWorldHint=False`.
- `fork_from_past(app_id, sequence_id)` resumes another session's state through
  the persister. Hidden from the listing when no `state_loader` or
  `LocalTrackingClient` is wired, since it would only ever refuse. Annotated
  `destructiveHint=True, openWorldHint=True` because the source state lives
  outside this session's history.

The annotations are FastMCP `ToolAnnotations`; capable clients render the
right confirmations and recovery affordances per tool.

Plus two synthetic tools from FastMCP's `ResourcesAsTools` transform,
`list_resources()` and `read_resource(uri)` (both `readOnlyHint=True`), so
tools-only clients can reach the `theodosia://` resources without
`resources/read`.

The action namespace lives in `step`'s `action` argument schema and at
`theodosia://graph`, not in the tool listing. The listing stays compact; the agent
learns the verbs from the graph resource.

### The step response

`step` returns two content blocks: a short human-readable summary line (for
clients that render server logs inline, like `Step 3: verify_usage ✓ → resolve`)
and a structured JSON payload with the machine-readable result. A programmatic
client should read the structured payload (FastMCP exposes it as
`result.structured_content`, or the JSON block of `result.content`), not the
summary string. Both success and refusal come back on this same shape: a refusal
is `{"error": "invalid_transition", "valid_next_actions": [...], ...}`, an
action-body failure is `{"error": "action_error", "error_message": "..."}`.

## Action selection

Burr's `astep` picks the next action via `app.get_next_action()`, which returns
the first transition whose condition is true. Under MCP the *client* named the
action to run. `_step_application` overrides `get_next_action` for the duration
of one step to return the client-named action, calls `astep`, then restores the
original. This is the bridge between MCP's "client chose X" semantics and
Burr's transition-condition semantics, and the only Burr internal Theodosia
touches.

Before running, the step checks reachability against the live transitions. An
unreachable action is refused with `invalid_transition` and the response carries
`valid_next_actions`, so a client without its own model of the graph can recover
from a single error.

## Per-session isolation

`mount(...)` accepts an `Application` instance (shared state across all
sessions) or a callable factory (one Application per MCP session). The session
store is a plain dict keyed by `ctx.session_id`, held in `mount`'s closure
scope. Each entry holds the Application built lazily on first touch, a
per-session `asyncio.Lock`, and the history and subrun records.

### The builder seam

A factory can return either a built `Application` or an *unbuilt*
`burr.core.ApplicationBuilder`. When it returns a builder, Theodosia calls
`builder.with_identifiers(app_id=session_id).build()`, so the Burr `app_id`
equals the FastMCP session id and the tracker directory
(`storage_dir/project/<session_id>/`) is bound to the session. It never drifts
when the session is reset, because the rebuild stamps the same id again. This is
the recommended form when you use Burr tracking. The `() -> Application` form and
a bare `Application` instance still work unchanged.

```python
def build_application():
    return (
        ApplicationBuilder()
        .with_actions(...)
        .with_transitions(...)
        .with_tracker(tracker(project="incident"))
        .with_entrypoint("acknowledge")   # no .build()
    )

mount(build_application, name="incident")
```

Eviction is lazy: stale entries are dropped on the next access, not on a
background timer. `session_ttl_seconds` (default 3600) and `max_sessions`
(default 100) each cap the store; set either to `None` to disable that form of
eviction.

FastMCP's `ctx.set_state(serializable=False)` is request-scoped, not
session-scoped, so it is not suitable for caching the Application across calls in
one session. The closure dict is.

## What `mount()` accepts

```python
mount(
    application_or_factory,
    *,
    name="theodosia",
    instructions=None,
    hooks=[...],                    # Burr LifecycleAdapter list
    middleware=[...],               # FastMCP Middleware list
    upstream={"name": {...}},       # other MCP servers callable from action bodies
    personas=...,                   # PERSONA.md identity layer
    state_loader=...,               # for fork_from_past against a custom persister
    action_timeout_seconds=None,    # hard timeout per action
    session_ttl_seconds=3600,
    max_sessions=100,
)
```

`hooks` are attached via Burr's public `LifecycleAdapterSet.with_new_adapters`,
the same path Burr uses internally to wire its own `TracerFactoryContextHook`.
Hooks attached this way fire on the same surfaces as
`ApplicationBuilder.with_hooks(...)`.

`middleware` runs after Theodosia's built-in input-coercion middleware, so user
middleware (OpenTelemetry, rate limiting, structured logging) sees the
post-coercion tool arguments.

`upstream` opens an MCP *client* session to each named server and binds them so
action bodies can call their tools via `theodosia.call_upstream(server, tool,
args)`. The agent sees only `step`; the upstream servers are not in its tool
listing. Every upstream call advances state by construction because it runs
inside an action body. See [Driving other MCP servers](upstream.md).

`mount_multi(applications, hooks=[...], middleware=[...])` composes several
Burr Applications into one MCP server with FastMCP namespacing; the kwargs
forward to every sub-application's `mount()` call.

## Persistence: save + resume

Persistence splits into two primitives that take the same persister:

- `ApplicationBuilder.with_state_persister(persister)` is the *saver*. Burr's
  `PersisterHook` calls `persister.save(...)` after every step.
- `ApplicationBuilder.initialize_from(persister, resume_at_next_action=True,
  default_state={...}, default_entrypoint="...")` is the *loader*. At session
  start it tries to read the latest snapshot for the current `app_id` and
  resumes mid-walk; falls back to the defaults when no snapshot exists.

You need both for a true save-and-resume loop. The `fork_from_past` meta-tool
also reaches the loader, so an agent can resurrect any past session by
`(app_id, sequence_id)` without anything in the factory. See
`examples/sqlite_persister.py` for both factories side by side.

## Input coercion middleware

`mount()` builds the FastMCP server with `strict_input_validation=False` and
adds a middleware that, for any `tools/call`, parses JSON-string values into
objects when the tool's declared schema allows object or array. The `step`
tool's `inputs` parameter is typed `dict | str | None` so the advertised schema
includes `string` in its `anyOf`.

Both moves are needed for clients that validate outbound requests against the
advertised schema (so the schema must accept the string form) and serialize
nested-object arguments as JSON strings (so the middleware must coerce them
before the action body runs).
