---

Theodosia's trust boundary sits between an agent's tool calls and the action
bodies that run them. The table below names what is trusted and what is not.

## What is trusted, and what is not

| Component | Trust | Why |
|---|---|---|
| The agent (the model) | **Untrusted** | It is the thing being constrained. Its tool calls are inputs to validate, not instructions to obey. |
| The graph and action bodies | **Trusted** | You wrote them. They run with your process's privileges. |
| Upstream MCP servers (`upstream`) | **Operator-configured** | You choose which servers an action may reach; they are not agent-selected. |
| A `.app` file, if used | **Trusted local** | It execs Python, so it is a local-authoring convenience, not a fetch-and-run format. |

## What Theodosia enforces

- **Reachability.** The agent can only run an action the graph allows from the
  current state. An out-of-order or unknown action comes back as a structured
  [refusal](refusals.md) with the reachable actions; it never executes.
- **State integrity.** State lives on the server, keyed per session. The agent
  cannot assert a state it is not in; every state change is the recorded result
  of a server-executed action.
- **Boundary validation.** The `step` tool advertises each action's declared
  input schema (types and `Literal` choices) to the caller, and where an action
  annotates a Pydantic model the dict is coerced into that model before the body
  runs. The server does **not** otherwise enforce scalar types or `Literal`
  values: a malformed value reaches the action body and surfaces as a structured
  `action_error`. Wire `input_validators` to reject bad inputs (as a
  `validation_failed` refusal) before the body runs.
- **An honest, verifiable record.** Every attempt, including refusals, is
  recorded to the per-session history and Burr's tracker, so the trail reflects
  what the agent tried, not its own account. Each attempt is also hash-chained
  into a `ledger.jsonl` next to the tracker log; `theodosia verify <session>`
  recomputes the chain and names the exact line where any entry was edited,
  reordered, or deleted after the fact. Entries carry the session's `app_id`,
  `project`, and `partition_key` in the hashed payload, so copying the file
  to a different session directory breaks verification.

## What the ledger proves and what it does not

The hash chain catches **in-place edits, reorderings, duplications, and
middle-deletions** of recorded entries. It does **not** catch:

- **Truncation.** Dropping the tail-most entry leaves a chain that still
  self-verifies. Detect by external commitment of expected length, or by
  streaming each entry to append-only storage as it is written.
- **Whole-cloth forgery in the default (unkeyed) mode.** The hash function
  is public, so anyone with write access to `ledger.jsonl` can mint a
  chain from scratch. Set `THEODOSIA_LEDGER_KEY` (hex-encoded bytes) in
  the server environment to switch the chain to HMAC-SHA256; forgery then
  requires the key.
- **Origin.** A signature over the head would add non-repudiation. The
  chain alone does not.
- **Existence of any particular session.** Deleting a whole session
  directory is invisible to `verify`; detect with an external session
  manifest.

For regulated audit trails (SOX, HIPAA, PCI, GxP), layer at least one of
HMAC mode, periodic external checkpointing (RFC 3161 timestamp authority
or transparency log), and an append-only object store with retention
locks on top. `ledger.jsonl` alone detects accidental corruption and the
naive editor; it does not survive a motivated insider with filesystem
write access.

## Per-session isolation

Per-session isolation requires **factory mode**: pass a `() -> Application`
factory to `mount()`. Each MCP session then gets its own `Application` instance,
keyed by FastMCP's `ctx.session_id`. The store lives in a closure scope inside
`mount()`, not in a module global, so two `mount()` calls in the same process do
not bleed sessions into each other.

Mounting a built `Application` instance instead is **shared-app mode**: every
session mutates one FSM, so there is no per-session isolation. On a multi-client
transport (HTTP/SSE, where `ctx.session_id` can be null) connected clients then
share one FSM and its state outright. `mount()` logs a warning in this mode, and
`fork_at` / `fork_from_past` / `reset_session` refuse. Use a factory for any
server more than one client can reach; reserve the instance form for a single
stdio client or a deliberately shared FSM.

`fork_from_past(app_id, partition_key=...)` reaches into a different
session's persisted state through the persister. To prevent a tenant-A
session from loading tenant-B's state by guessing an `app_id`, the
caller-supplied `partition_key` is compared against the session's bound
`_partition_key` (set by `ApplicationBuilder.with_identifiers(...)`).
A mismatch returns a `partition_mismatch` refusal *before* the persister
is reached, so a malicious tenant cannot even confirm whether the
requested `app_id` exists in another partition. See
`tests/test_fork_from_past_partition_binding.py` for the regression that
pins this behaviour.

## Supply chain

Releases publish a CycloneDX SBOM as a workflow artifact
(`.github/workflows/release.yml`). Direct runtime deps are Apache 2.0
or MIT (no copyleft); pin `uv.lock` and mirror to your own index for an
auditable build.

## What `reads=` enforces and what it does not

A typed action's `reads=[...]` declaration is enforced at the action-body
level via Burr's per-action Pydantic input projection: the body cannot
access state fields it did not declare. This makes patterns like
Chain-of-Verification's "independent verification" property structural
between action bodies.

`reads=` is **not** a confidentiality boundary on the MCP wire:

- The step response includes the full post-step state.
- `theodosia://state` returns the full state unconditionally.

If your threat model is "the agent must not see field X", filter the
state in a separate layer (a `state_loader` callback, an MCP middleware,
or by partitioning the FSM so X never lands in the same Application
state). `reads=` is the contract between the FSM graph and the action
body's Python code; it is not the contract between the server and the
LLM client.

## What Theodosia does not do

- It does **not sandbox action bodies.** Your action code runs with full process
  privileges; treat it as you would any code you ship. Theodosia controls *when*
  an action runs, not *what* your code is allowed to do.
- It does **not constrain reasoning inside a valid step.** It removes structural
  failures (skipping, early termination, unverified success); it does not make a
  wrong-but-legal step right.
- It does **not authenticate the agent or the MCP transport.** Run it behind your
  own transport security (stdio in-process, or an authenticated HTTP front).
- It does **not cap state size or depth.** A 100MB state value or a
  500-level-nested dict will be materialized in full in the step response
  and the tracker log. Add an action-body-level size check if the FSM may
  receive large external data.
- It does **not garbage-collect fork descendants.** Every `fork_at` /
  `fork_from_past` creates a fresh `app_id` directory in the tracker
  storage root. `max_sessions` caps the in-memory session map; it does
  not cap on-disk fork directories. Reap them out of band.
