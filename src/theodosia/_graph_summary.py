"""User-facing graph descriptions: action surface text + graph summary dict.

Three builders that turn an ``Application``'s topology into things the
client sees:

* ``_render_action_surface`` - compact text appended to the server's
  ``instructions`` so a connecting MCP client sees the action namespace
  at connect time, before reading any resources.
* ``_compute_graph_summary`` - full structured description returned by
  ``theodosia://graph``. Cold-start discovery surface: one resource read
  and the model has the whole topology.
* ``_normalize_external_tools`` / ``_next_external_tools`` - sanitize
  and filter the per-action external-tools advisory map.

This module is pure introspection: takes an Application, returns data.
No closure coupling to ``mount()``.
