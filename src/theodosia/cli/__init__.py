"""``theodosia`` CLI: serve, validate, and observe Burr Applications mounted as MCP servers.

Subcommands:

  theodosia serve <target>         Mount an importable Burr Application or factory.
  theodosia doctor <target>        Statically validate (and optionally probe at runtime).
  theodosia ui                     Launch Burr's web UI.
  theodosia sessions ls            Table of recent tracked sessions.
  theodosia sessions show <id>     Full post-mortem timeline of one session.
  theodosia sessions tail [id]     Live-tail a running session (rich render).
  theodosia watch [id]             Alias for `sessions tail`.
  theodosia logs [id]              Compact one-line-per-step log, greppable.
  theodosia status                 Tracker storage + recent activity snapshot.
  theodosia report [id]            Markdown post-mortem of one session.
  theodosia verify [id]            Verify a session's tamper-evident ledger.
  theodosia render <target>        Render the FSM graph as text / mermaid / dot.

Every observability command reads ``~/.{prog_name}`` (Burr's
``LocalTrackingClient`` storage) — ``~/.theodosia`` for the default
CLI, or the brand-derived directory for a rebrand — so it works
against any session a mounted server has written, including those
running right now in another process.

Implementation lives in submodules grouped by command family. This
``__init__`` keeps the public import surface flat: existing callers
``from theodosia.cli import build_cli, run, app`` and tests reaching for
``_burr_ui_url`` / ``_read_steps`` / etc keep working unchanged.
