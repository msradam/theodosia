"""Hash-chained ledger writes + refusal sidecar.

Two append-only audit surfaces live next to Burr's per-session
``log.jsonl``:

* ``ledger.jsonl`` - every attempt (success or refusal), hash-chained.
  Read back by ``theodosia verify`` to detect after-the-fact edits,
  reorders, and middle-deletions.
* ``refusals.jsonl`` - refusals only, plain JSONL. Burr's tracker only
  records actions that ran, so an ``invalid_transition`` (the graph
  blocking an out-of-order call) never reaches the on-disk log without
  this sidecar.

Both are no-ops when the Application has no ``LocalTrackingClient``,
so a graph mounted without a tracker keeps working.
