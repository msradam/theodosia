"""Mount a Burr Application as a FastMCP server.

One serving mode:

  • ``ServingMode.STEP``:    One ``step(action_name, **inputs)``
                             meta-tool. Server enforces valid
                             transitions. The four-tool surface
                             (step + reset_session + fork_at +
                             fork_from_past) is constant across every
                             FSM, regardless of action count, so the
                             tool listing stays compact while the
                             action namespace lives in step's argument
                             schema and ``theodosia://graph``.

The mount registers eight resources:

  • ``theodosia://graph``:           static description of the FSM topology
                                (actions, reads/writes/inputs, edges
                                with conditions). Read once per session.
  • ``theodosia://state``:           current Application state as JSON.
  • ``theodosia://next``:            actions reachable from current state.
  • ``theodosia://history``:         per-session timeline of every action
                                attempt (successes + refusals).
  • ``theodosia://trace``:           Burr's on-disk LocalTrackingClient log.
  • ``theodosia://session``:         tracker coordinates (project, app_id,
                                app_dir, partition_key) for locating
                                this session's data on disk.
  • ``theodosia://subruns``:         index of sub-Application runs spawned
                                in this session via ``spawn_subapp``.
  • ``theodosia://subruns/{id}``:    full record for one sub-run.

Per-session isolation:

  Pass a callable factory ``() -> Application`` instead of an
  ``Application`` instance. Each MCP session then gets its own
  Application built lazily on first tool call and stored in FastMCP's
  session state. Two clients connected to the same server see
  independent state.

  Passing an Application instance directly preserves the simpler
  shared-state behavior, where all sessions mutate one FSM.

    """Return a FastMCP server that exposes ``application`` per ``mode``.

    Args:
        application: Either a built ``burr.core.Application`` (shared
            across all sessions) or a callable ``() -> Application``
            (called once per session for state isolation). The graph
            shape is read once at mount time, so factories should
            return Applications with the same graph each call.
        mode: ``ServingMode.STEP`` (the only supported value).
        name: MCP server name; defaults to ``"theodosia"``.
        instructions: Server-level instructions surfaced via the MCP
            spec's server-info ``instructions`` field. When
            ``include_default_instructions`` is True (the default), the
            machinery preamble (``DEFAULT_INSTRUCTIONS``) is prepended to
            this string so the agent gets both how-to-drive-an-FSM guidance
            and your FSM-specific guidance. Pass an empty string to suppress
            the developer portion while still keeping the default preamble.
        include_default_instructions: Whether to prepend
            ``DEFAULT_INSTRUCTIONS`` (the validated 5-rule machinery preamble)
            to the server's instructions. Default True. Floor-tested to lift
            qwen3:0.6b from 0/10 to 10/10 on a trivial FSM, with no regression
            on stronger models. Pass False if you want full control over what
            the agent sees.
        personas: An optional identity layer. Accepts a directory path (parses
            every ``*.md`` file as a PERSONA.md), a single file path, a dict
            ``{name: text}``, or a list of ``Persona`` objects. Each persona is
            registered as an MCP prompt named ``theodosia/persona/<name>`` so
            clients can pick one at session-start, and the full set is
            exposed at ``theodosia://personas``. If unset, the server has no
            identity layer (the historical Theodosia behavior).
        default_persona: The persona whose body is prepended to the server's
            ``instructions`` for clients that don't pick one explicitly. Must
            be one of the loaded persona names, or ``None`` (default) to use
            the lexically first persona. Ignored if no personas are loaded.
        session_ttl_seconds: Idle TTL for the per-session store. After
            this many seconds without a tool call or resource read, a
            session's Application and history are evicted on the next
            access. Set to ``None`` to disable TTL eviction. Default
            3600 (1 hour).
        max_sessions: Hard cap on simultaneous live sessions in the
            store. When exceeded, the least-recently-accessed entry
            is evicted on insert. Set to ``None`` to disable size
            eviction. Default 100.
        action_timeout_seconds: Server-wide timeout applied to every
            action invocation. Wraps ``app.astep`` in
            ``asyncio.wait_for``; on expiry the action's coroutine is
            cancelled and the call returns an ``action_timeout`` error
            without advancing state. ``None`` (default) means no
            timeout. Cancellation is prompt for async actions doing
            I/O; for sync or CPU-bound work it's best-effort.
        input_validators: Optional mapping of action name to a
            validator callable ``(state_dict, inputs) -> dict | None``.
            Runs before action dispatch. May raise ``ValidationFailed``
            to refuse the call, return a dict to substitute normalised
            inputs, or return None to accept the originals. Async
            validators are supported. ToolSpec-declared validators
            from the importer also work; per-action attribute
            ``fn._theodosia_validator`` is the hand-tagged escape hatch.
        state_loader: Optional Burr ``BaseStateLoader`` (SQLite, S3,
            Postgres, etc.) used by ``fork_from_past``. Resolution order:
            this loader wins; else the current Application's
            ``LocalTrackingClient``; else refuse.
        next_hint: Optional callback for domain-specific reactive
            guidance. Receives ``(state, valid_next_actions, last_action,
            refusal=None)`` and returns a single-line natural-language
            hint, or ``None`` to defer to the structural auto-hint.
            Called after every step success and every refusal. The
            returned string (or the auto-hint when this returns None)
            is appended to the step response as ``next_hint``. Closes
            the gap weaker agent models hit when enumeration of valid
            actions isn't enough -- they need direction, not just a list.
            Backwards-compatible: three-arg callbacks (without the
            ``refusal`` parameter) still work.
        external_tools: Experimental, advisory. Prefer ``upstream`` for
            driving other MCP servers. This is the fallback for the case
            where Theodosia cannot be in the call path (the agent reaches a
            server Theodosia can't, e.g. a separate auth or network
            boundary). Maps an action name to tool names on OTHER MCP
            servers the agent is connected to. Surfaced per-action in
            ``theodosia://graph`` and contextually as ``next_external_tools``
            in each ``step`` response, as advisory guidance only: the
            agent calls those tools on its own connected servers, then
            ``step()``s. Theodosia neither executes nor validates them.
            Being a two-surface design, it relies on the model's
            discipline and works best with capable models. Unknown action
            names are ignored with a warning at mount time.
        upstream: Optional mapping of server name to a ``fastmcp.Client``
            transport spec (a URL string, an mcp-config dict, or a
            transport object). theodosia opens an MCP *client* session to
            each and binds them so action bodies can call their tools via
            ``theodosia.call_upstream(server, tool, args)``. Unlike
            ``external_tools`` (advisory; the agent calls tools on its own
            connected servers), ``upstream`` puts theodosia in the call path:
            the agent sees only theodosia's ``step`` tool, the upstream
            servers are not exposed to it, and every upstream call happens
            inside an action so it advances state by construction. This is
            the single-surface, ledger-honest way to drive any MCP server
            from a graph, and it works with any compliant server because
            ``fastmcp.Client`` speaks every transport. Sessions open
            lazily on first use and stay open for the server's lifetime.
        hooks: Optional list of Burr ``LifecycleAdapter`` instances
            (``PreRunStepHook``, ``PostRunStepHook``, ``PreStartStreamHook``,
            ``DoLogAttributeHook``, etc.). Attached to every session's
            Application after construction. Equivalent to calling
            ``ApplicationBuilder.with_hooks(...)`` inside the factory, but
            keeps adapter-side concerns (timing, custom telemetry sinks,
            structured logging) out of the factory.
        middleware: Optional list of FastMCP ``Middleware`` instances added
            to the mounted server after Theodosia's built-in input-coercion
            middleware. Useful for OTel spans on every MCP call, rate
            limiting, structured logging, or per-call metrics; the
            ``with_middleware`` example demo uses this pattern with
            ``TimingMiddleware`` / ``StructuredLoggingMiddleware`` /
            ``RateLimitingMiddleware``. Order matters: middleware added
            earlier wraps later ones, so these run inside the coercion
            layer (they see post-coercion args).

    """Mount multiple Burr Applications as one MCP server.

    Each application is wrapped by ``mount()`` independently, then
    composed into a parent FastMCP via FastMCP's native server-
    composition (``parent.mount(sub, namespace=...)``). Namespacing
    rules follow FastMCP:

    * Tools are renamed ``<app>_<tool>``. In STEP mode this means each
      app exposes ``<app>_step``, ``<app>_reset_session``,
      ``<app>_fork_at``, ``<app>_fork_from_past``.
    * Resources keep their scheme but get the namespace inserted:
      ``theodosia://graph`` from app ``order`` becomes ``theodosia://order/graph``.

    Args:
        applications: Mapping of namespace name to Application or
            factory. Names must be valid Python identifiers
            (alphanumeric + underscore, starting with a letter) so the
            FastMCP namespacing rule produces clean tool / resource
            names.
        mode: Serving mode applied to every sub-application.
        name: Parent server name surfaced to MCP clients.
        instructions: Server-level instructions for the parent. The
            per-app instructions (with the auto-described action
            surface) remain on each sub-server.
        session_ttl_seconds, max_sessions, action_timeout_seconds:
            Forwarded to each sub-application's ``mount()`` call.
        hooks: Burr ``LifecycleAdapter`` instances forwarded to each
            sub-application's ``mount()`` call. Attached to every
            sub-application's sessions; if you need per-app hooks, mount
            them separately and compose manually.
        middleware: FastMCP ``Middleware`` instances forwarded to each
            sub-application's ``mount()`` call. Each sub-server's middleware
            sees the post-routing tool name (``step``, not ``<app>_step``)
            because FastMCP composition strips the namespace before
            dispatching to the sub-server. The parent server is not
            middleware-wrapped here; add middleware to the returned FastMCP
            with ``server.add_middleware(...)`` if you want a single
            wrapper around all sub-servers.

    A ``theodosia://apps`` resource on the parent lists the mounted app
    names so a connecting agent can discover the namespace surface in
    one read.
