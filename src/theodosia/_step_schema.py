"""Pydantic models + JSON Schema for the ``step`` tool's response.

The Pydantic models declare the contract clients see in ``step``'s output
schema; the body of ``step`` returns plain dicts shaped to match these.
The schema function emits the merged-object JSON Schema MCP expects (one
top-level ``type: "object"`` with the ``error`` field as the
discriminator), since MCP does not accept a union at the top level.

This module is the wire contract; everything else in the adapter shapes
data to land in one of these shapes.
