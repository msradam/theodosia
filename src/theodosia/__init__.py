"""theodosia: mount Burr Applications as MCP servers.

State lives on the server. Every mounted server exposes a constant
four-tool surface (``step``, ``reset_session``, ``fork_at``,
``fork_from_past``) regardless of FSM complexity; the action namespace
lives in ``step``'s argument schema and at ``theodosia://graph``. Plus two
synthetic tools from FastMCP's ``ResourcesAsTools`` transform
(``list_resources``, ``read_resource``) for clients that don't
implement native ``resources/read`` (IBM Bob Shell as of mid-2026).

``TOOLS`` and ``DYNAMIC`` serving modes were carved into
``theodosia._experimental.modes`` once ``STEP`` became the sole product;
the ``ServingMode`` enum keeps ``STEP`` as its only member so callers
passing ``mode=ServingMode.STEP`` keep working.

    """A Burr ``LocalTrackingClient`` that defaults its store to ``~/.theodosia``.

    Use this in your builder (``.with_tracker(theodosia.tracker("my-project"))``)
    to keep LLM-driven session traces separate from code-driven Burr runs, which
    use Burr's own ``~/.burr`` default. It is a thin wrapper; pass any
    ``LocalTrackingClient`` keyword through.

    Resolution order for ``storage_dir``: explicit argument wins; otherwise
    ``THEODOSIA_HOME`` env var; otherwise the ``home=`` Theodosia's CLI was
    branded with via :func:`build_cli` for the current process; otherwise
    ``~/.theodosia``. This keeps a downstream rebrand's tracker writes and
    CLI reads pointed at the same root without forcing every author to
    thread ``storage_dir`` through manually.

    Note for standalone scripts (seeding/tests that build the app *outside*
    the CLI process, where ``build_cli`` never ran): the branded ``home`` is
    not visible, so writes land in ``~/.theodosia``. Pass ``storage_dir``
    explicitly, or set ``THEODOSIA_HOME``, to land them in the branded store.
