"""Per-session bookkeeping: the lazy TTL + max-size store and one entry.

A session is keyed by FastMCP's ``ctx.session_id``. Each entry owns the
Application instance (factory mode) plus the per-session attempt history,
sub-run records, and an ``asyncio.Lock`` that serializes ``app.astep``
calls within one session. Different sessions still proceed in parallel.

Re-exported from :mod:`theodosia.adapter` for backwards compatibility.

    ``application`` is None in shared-app mode (the server has one
    Application that all sessions mutate; per-session apps aren't
    created). ``history`` is always per-session: each session sees
    only the timeline of its own calls.

    ``lock`` serializes ``app.astep`` calls within one session. Burr
    Applications are not thread-safe, and frontier clients can fire
    parallel tool calls within one MCP session (the protocol permits
    it). The lock means concurrent step calls from the same session
    queue rather than racing on the Application's state pointer.
    Different sessions still proceed in parallel.

    ``subruns`` holds the timelines of any sub-Applications spawned
    from inside this session's actions via ``theodosia.spawn_subapp``.
    Each entry has its own id, label, started/ended timestamps,
    history list, and optional final state. Subrun ids are surfaced
    on the parent action's history entry via the ``subruns`` key so
    a client can correlate "the analyse action spawned subrun X" with
    "subrun X had the following timeline."
