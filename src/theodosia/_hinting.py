"""Reactive next_hint: the steering string appended after every step.

After every step (success or refusal), Theodosia appends a single
``next_hint`` string to the response. The hint is generated in two
layers:

1. **Auto-hint** (this module): derived from graph introspection alone --
   what transitions are reachable, what kind of refusal just happened,
   whether the session is terminal. No domain knowledge required; works
   for any Burr graph mounted via ``mount()``.

2. **Domain hint** (caller-supplied ``next_hint`` callback): receives
   the same structural signals plus the refusal payload, and can return
   a domain-specific override. When provided and non-None, it replaces
   the auto-hint; otherwise the auto-hint is used.

The split mirrors POSIX: errno (structural taxonomy) lives at the kernel
layer; strerror (semantic translation) lives at the libc layer.
