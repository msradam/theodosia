"""Lift an existing FastMCP server into a Burr Application.

The shape of ``theodosia`` so far has been one-way: write a Burr graph,
mount it as an MCP server. The other direction is the more common
starting point: someone already has a FastMCP server with a flat list
of tools, and they want to gain transition enforcement, audit history,
and per-session isolation without rewriting everything.

This module takes that flat server plus a declaration of the implicit
state machine and produces a ``burr.core.Application`` ready to pass
back to ``theodosia.mount``. The implicit state machine isn't inferred,
it's declared, because guessing reads/writes from parameter names is
lossy and silently wrong. The user names which tools mutate which
state keys and which transitions are valid. The library handles the
signature wiring and the re-exposure.

Typical pattern:

    flat = FastMCP("legacy")

    @flat.tool
    async def create_order(item: str) -> dict:
        return {"order_id": "ORD-1", "item": item}

    @flat.tool
    async def pay(order_id: str, amount: float) -> dict:
        return {"paid": True}

    @flat.tool
    async def fulfill(order_id: str) -> dict:
        return {"status": "fulfilled"}

    app = await burr_app_from_fastmcp(
        flat,
        initial_state={"order_id": None, "paid": False},
        tool_specs={
            "create_order": ToolSpec(writes=["order_id"], merge_result=True),
            "pay":          ToolSpec(reads=["order_id"], writes=["paid"], merge_result=True),
            "fulfill":      ToolSpec(reads=["order_id", "paid"]),
        },
        transitions=[("create_order", "pay"), ("pay", "fulfill")],
        entrypoint="create_order",
    )

    server = mount(app, mode=ServingMode.STEP, name="lifted")

What carries over from the original tools:

  • Parameter names, types, and defaults (preserved on the wrapped
    function's signature so theodosia's later schema generation sees
    the same inputs the user already wrote).
  • Docstrings (used as the action's description).
  • Async/sync nature (wrapper preserves it).

class ToolSpec:
    """Declares how one FastMCP tool participates in the Burr graph.

    ``reads`` / ``writes`` mirror Burr's ``@action`` parameters: which
    keys of shared state the action consults and which it can mutate.
    Tools that don't touch shared state get empty lists and act purely
    as transition gates (they run side effects, the graph moves on).

    ``merge_result`` controls how the tool's return value flows into
    state. When True, the tool's return is expected to be a dict; keys
    matching ``writes`` are merged into state (other keys are ignored).
    When False, the tool's return value is discarded and state is left
    unchanged. ``state_update`` is an optional explicit callable that
    takes the tool's result and returns a ``{key: value}`` dict to
    apply; it overrides ``merge_result``.

    ``rename`` lets the user change the action's name in the resulting
    Burr graph without renaming the original tool. Useful when two
    flat servers each had a ``status`` tool and they're being merged.

    ``timeout_seconds`` declares a per-action timeout. The importer
    annotates the wrapped action with this value via a function
    attribute; ``mount`` reads it back and applies it only to this
    action, taking precedence over the server-wide
    ``action_timeout_seconds`` on ``mount``. Set to ``None`` (the
    default) to inherit the server-wide setting.

    ``validator`` declares an input validator that runs before the
    tool fires. It receives ``(state_dict, inputs)`` and may raise
    ``theodosia.ValidationFailed`` to refuse, return a dict to
    substitute normalised inputs, or return None to accept the
    originals unchanged. Same shape as the ``input_validators={}``
    mapping on ``mount``; per-tool here takes precedence over the
    server-wide map.
