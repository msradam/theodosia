"""Static validation for Burr Applications before mounting them.

``theodosia doctor module:attr`` runs a set of checks against an
Application (or a factory returning one) and reports findings without
ever calling ``astep``. Catches the classes of bug that only surface at
runtime against the real MCP client:

* import target unresolvable
* factory raises on build
* graph has unreachable actions
* graph has dead-end actions (no outgoing transitions other than the
  terminal node the author intended)
* actions read state keys that nothing writes and nothing seeds in
  ``with_state(...)``
* initial state defines keys no action ever reads (loose noise, not an
  error but worth surfacing)

Importable as a library too: ``from theodosia.doctor import run_checks``
returns a :class:`DoctorReport` you can fold into your own test suite.
