Theodosia mounts a [Burr](https://burr.dagworks.io/) `Application` as an MCP server. Every Burr action is reachable through a single `step(action, inputs)` tool; the server checks reachability against the graph before each action runs, refuses out-of-order calls with the legal next moves, and records every attempt.

## Install

Python 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13 (Burr does not yet support 3.14). On a fresh Python 3.14 install you will see "no version that satisfies the requirement theodosia"; create a 3.11–3.13 venv first.

```bash
uv venv --python 3.13       # or: python3.13 -m venv .venv
uv pip install theodosia    # or: pip install theodosia
```

Optional extras: `theodosia[observability]`, `theodosia[ui]`, `theodosia[claude]`, `theodosia[mellea]`, `theodosia[all]`.

On a slim Docker image (`python:3.13-slim`, Alpine) the install pulls a `psutil` build that needs `gcc` and `python3-dev`. Either use the full `python:3.13` image, or `apt-get install -y gcc python3-dev` before `pip install`.

## Try it without an API key

```bash
theodosia primer
```

Walks the coffee-order FSM through Theodosia's `step` tool in-process and prints the timeline with state diffs and one structured refusal. No LLM, no network, same output every run.

## Quickstart

```python
from burr.core import ApplicationBuilder, State, action
from burr.core.action import Condition
from theodosia import mount


@action(reads=[], writes=["item", "stage"])
def take_order(state: State, item: str) -> State:
    return state.update(item=item, stage="ordered")


@action(reads=["stage"], writes=["stage"])
def pay(state: State, amount: float) -> State:
    return state.update(stage="paid")


def build_application():
    is_ordered = Condition.expr("stage == 'ordered'")
    return (
        ApplicationBuilder()
        .with_actions(take_order=take_order, pay=pay)
        .with_transitions(("take_order", "pay", is_ordered))
        .with_state(item=None, stage="empty")
        .with_entrypoint("take_order")
        .build()
    )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    mount(build_application, name="coffee").run()
```

Save as `coffee.py` and run `python coffee.py` to serve over stdio. Pass a factory (a callable returning a built `Application`) so each MCP session gets its own isolated state. Passing an already-built `Application` works too but shares state across sessions.

Exercise the server in-process with FastMCP's `Client`:

```python
import asyncio
from fastmcp import Client
from coffee import build_application

async def main():
    async with Client(mount(build_application, name="coffee")) as client:
        r = await client.call_tool("step", {"action": "pay", "inputs": {"amount": 5.0}})
        print(r.structured_content)
        r = await client.call_tool("step", {"action": "take_order", "inputs": {"item": "mocha"}})
        r = await client.call_tool("step", {"action": "pay", "inputs": {"amount": 5.0}})
        print(r.structured_content)

asyncio.run(main())
```

A client that calls `pay` before `take_order` gets a structured refusal it can recover from:

```json
{ "error": "invalid_transition", "valid_next_actions": ["take_order"] }
```

## Primitives

- **`mount(application, *, hooks=[...], middleware=[...], upstream=..., personas=...)`** wraps a Burr `Application` (or factory) as a FastMCP server. Returns the server; call `.run()` or pass to FastMCP's in-memory `Client`. Optional kwargs forward Burr `LifecycleAdapter`, FastMCP `Middleware`, upstream MCP clients, and `PERSONA.md` identity layers.
- **The four MCP tools** every mounted server exposes: `step(action, inputs)`, `reset_session`, `fork_at(sequence_id)`, `fork_from_past(app_id, sequence_id)`. The action namespace lives in `step`'s argument schema; FSM complexity changes the schema, not the tool count. FastMCP's `ResourcesAsTools` transform adds `list_resources` and `read_resource` for clients that lack native `resources/read`.
- **Structured refusals** from `step`: `invalid_transition`, `unknown_action`, `validation_failed`, `action_timeout`, `action_error`. Every refusal carries `valid_next_actions`. `fork_at` / `fork_from_past` return their own `error` codes on the same wire shape.
- **`theodosia://` resources** for inspection: `graph`, `state`, `next`, `history`, `subruns`, `trace`, `session`.
- **`upstream`** lets a Burr action body call tools on other MCP servers through `call_upstream(server, tool, args)`. The agent driving Theodosia never sees those servers; it only sees `step`.

Full reference (Persona, Assembly, hooks, middleware, tracker, `drive_claude`) lives in the [docs](https://msradam.github.io/theodosia/).

## Scope

Theodosia does not include an agent, a model, or a workflow engine. It mounts an existing Burr `Application` and gates an MCP client's access to it. The rails are only as tight as the graph you author.

## Benchmarks (preliminary)

Theodosia's headline property is structural and holds regardless of any accuracy number: every step an agent takes, and every step it was refused, lands in a typed, replayable, hash-chained ledger. The benchmark below is supporting evidence.

On IBM Research's [ITBench SRE benchmark](https://github.com/itbench-hub/ITBench), scored by the benchmark's own judge, taking one agent (`claude-haiku-4-5`) and gating its procedure with Theodosia significantly improved root-cause entity F1 over the same raw agent (0.561 vs 0.408, paired p<0.01), driven by the gate suppressing noise in the agent's conclusions. Same model, same prompt, same tools, same data; the only change is the gate. Preliminary: one model, one judge, 35 scenarios. Full methodology, the FSM, and the seven validity controls: [theodosia-bench](https://github.com/msradam/theodosia-bench/blob/main/RESULTS.md).

## Command line

```bash
theodosia serve module:app                       # mount as MCP server (stdio, default)
theodosia serve module:app --transport http --port 8000   # serve over HTTP
theodosia render module:app                      # draw the state machine in the terminal
theodosia doctor module:app                      # statically validate the graph; exits nonzero for CI
theodosia sessions show <id>                     # full timeline: per-step state diff + timing
theodosia sessions diff <a> <b>                  # cross-session: action-path divergence + final-state diff
theodosia watch                                  # live-tail a running session
theodosia logs --refusals                        # only the steps that were refused
theodosia status                                 # tracker storage + recent activity snapshot
theodosia verify                                 # recompute the ledger hash chain
theodosia primer                                 # offline first-touch, no API key
theodosia ui                                     # open the Burr UI
```

A downstream package can ship its own command (`my-fsm serve`, `my-fsm doctor`, ...) with `build_cli`.

Theodosia is glue between two libraries that do the hard parts: [Apache Burr](https://github.com/apache/burr) provides the state-machine `Application`, the transition graph, and the tracking UI; [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) provides the MCP server, the transforms, and the client behind `upstream`.
