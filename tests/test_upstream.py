"""upstream: theodosia as an MCP client to other servers.

A Burr action calls call_upstream(server, tool, args) from its body; the
call is forwarded to a real MCP server theodosia connected to as a client.
The agent only ever sees theodosia's `step` tool -- the upstream server is
not exposed to it (single surface). Every upstream call happens inside an
action, so it advances state (ledger).
