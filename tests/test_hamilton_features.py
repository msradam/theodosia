"""Burr-plus-Hamilton FSM: gating, math, and end-to-end walk.

Tests cover the Hamilton feature DAG in isolation, the input
validation on submit_application, that compute_features writes every
Hamilton-derived feature into Burr state, the threshold logic in
score_risk, the band-to-decision mapping in decide, the full
happy-path walk to the terminal, and that the FSM refuses
out-of-order calls.
