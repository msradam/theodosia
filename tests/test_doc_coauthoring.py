"""Skill-to-FSM: doc co-authoring workflow as caller-LLM prompts.

The FSM is pure orchestration, with no server-side LLM calls and
no shellouts, so tests just exercise the transitions and the
prompt-emission. The agent is simulated by feeding canned artifacts
into each action's inputs and reading ``state.current_prompt``
afterward.
