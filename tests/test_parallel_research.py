"""Parallel research agent: fan-out across real doc folders.

The example searches a shipped markdown corpus under
``examples/data/parallel_research/{services,runbooks,faqs}/``. Each
source folder spawns a four-step search sub-Application that runs
concurrently with the others via ``asyncio.gather``. Tests cover:

- happy path: a relevant query returns hits from every source.
- scoring is discriminative: the right doc tops each source.
- source filtering: ``sources=["services"]`` only spawns one sub-run.
- bad source name: clear error with the available source list.
- no matches: zero-score queries report nothing rather than crashing.
- sub-run history populated: the four-step trace is on the subrun
  record (relies on v1.10.0 spawn_subapp trace passthrough).
- concurrency: N sub-runs finish in roughly one sub-run's time.
