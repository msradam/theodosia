"""Granite-in-the-graph: on-call alert triage demo.

Tests monkey-patch ``_call_granite`` to return canned responses so
the FSM behavior is exercised hermetically (no Ollama required).
Covers the happy path, the retry-then-succeed loop, both
three-strikes routes to human (severity and service), output
normalisation (trailing punctuation, mixed case), the deterministic
runbook lookup, and that the transition layer advertises the right
``valid_next_actions`` mid-retry.
