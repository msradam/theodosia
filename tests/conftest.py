"""Shared fixtures.

The coffee-order example doubles as the canonical test FSM. Tests
build a fresh Application per test so state never leaks across cases.

Example servers that wire a ``LocalTrackingClient`` would otherwise
write log files into the dev's real ``~/.burr/`` on every test run.
The ``_isolate_burr_home`` autouse fixture redirects ``HOME`` to a
per-test ``tmp_path`` so any tracker activity ends up under that
directory and gets cleaned up with the rest of the temp tree. Tests
that explicitly need to control ``HOME`` (e.g. ``test_fork_from_past``)
override it via their own ``monkeypatch.setenv`` call; the explicit
setting wins.

# text to a non-tty. CI forces color, so pin plain output here: drop the
# force-color vars (they beat NO_COLOR), set NO_COLOR, and pin a wide width
# so nothing wraps. Makes help text deterministic regardless of environment.
